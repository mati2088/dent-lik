/**
 * This implementation of the {@apilink Ability|ability} to {@apilink BrowseTheWeb}
 * enables the {@apilink Actor} to interact with web front-ends using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
 *
 * ## Using Playwright to `BrowseTheWeb`
 *
 * In the example below, we configure the ability to {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright} with a Playwright
 * [`Browser`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser) so that Serenity/JS {@apilink Actor|actors}
 * can create a new [`BrowserContext`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext) and
 * instantiate Playwright [`page`s](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) as and when needed.
 *
 * This configuration allows Serenity/JS to control the process of launching and shutting down browser instances
 * and is useful when your test runner, e.g. [Cucumber.js](/api/cucumber), doesn't offer this functionality.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
 * import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from '@serenity-js/playwright'
 * import { By, Navigate, PageElement, Text } from '@serenity-js/web'
 * import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
 * import { Browser, chromium } from 'playwright'
 *
 * const HomePage = {
 *   title: () =>
 *     PageElement.located(By.css('h1')).describedAs('title')
 * }
 *
 * const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
 *
 * await actorCalled('Wendy')
 *   .whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.using(browser))
 *   .attemptsTo(
 *     Navigate.to(`https://serenity-js.org`),
 *     Ensure.that(Text.of(HomePage.title()), equals('Serenity/JS')),
 *   )
 * ```
 *
 * ## Using `BrowseTheWeb` with an existing Playwright `page`
 *
 * Test runners like [Playwright Test](/api/playwright-test/) manage Playwright browsers for you
 * and offer a [`page`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) instance you can
 * inject into the ability to {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright}.
 *
 * Note that [Serenity/JS Playwright Test module](/api/playwright-test/)
 * automatically configures all your {@apilink Actor|actors}
 * with an ability to {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright},
 * so you don't need to do it by hand unless you want to override the {@apilink SerenityOptions|default configuration}.
 *
 * The example below demonstrates how to use the {@apilink BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.usingPage} API and
 * override the default {@apilink Cast} of actors.
 *
 * ```ts title="specs/example.spec.ts"
 * import { describe, it, test } from '@playwright/playwright-test'
 * import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from '@serenity-js/playwright'
 * import { By, Navigate, PageElement, Text } from '@serenity-js/web'
 * import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
 *
 * const HomePage = {
 *   title: () =>
 *     PageElement.located(By.css('h1')).describedAs('title')
 * }
 *
 * describe('Serenity/JS with Playwright', () => {
 *
 *   test.use({
 *     actors: async ({ page, contextOptions }, use) => {
 *       await use(
 *         Cast.where((actorName: string) => {
 *           return actor.whoCan(
 *             BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.usingPage(page),
 *             // ... add any other abilities
 *           )
 *         })
 *       )
 *     }
 *   })
 *
 *   it('lets you reuse an existing page', async ({ actor }) => {
 *     await actor.attemptsTo(
 *       Navigate.to(`https://serenity-js.org`),
 *       Ensure.that(Text.of(HomePage.title()), equals('Serenity/JS')),
 *     )
 *   })
 * })
 * ```
